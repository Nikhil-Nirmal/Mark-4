In history, the video games has ruled since 1950 till the present date, the world of games has given many so much and taken too.
The gaming industry evolved from 1958's Simple Tennis game to today's G.T.A. 5, Farcry series, Red Dead Redemption 2.
 The growth of the gaming community in the present world has beaten Hollywood and the music industry in terms of entertainment.
The Games present in today's date are live proof of the level of our world's gaming community and Computer Engineers.


Esports Development :

The first-ever game to be played on a large scale live is the "Quake Game", held by the Annihilation tournament resulted in 2000 participants across the states. From the Annihilation tournament for Quake Game to the 2021 Free Fire World Series, a Garena Free Fire Tournament Hosted by Singapore. which had nearly 5.41 million viewers.

Currently in India, the gaming scene is booming, there are dozens of Esports organizations acquiring thousands of emerging gamers across the country. The digital revolution of the past 10 years has rocketed the number of gamers in India as some of the known gaming legends like Mortal, Carryminati, Dynamo continue to inspire the people. An Indian esports team known as S8ul has invested more than 5 million dollars in their players.

The Whole gaming community has been scattered to play a different range of games like BGMI, COD mobile, Free fire in mobile gaming and Pubg pc, Apex Legends, and Valorant in Pc games. The esports community in India is growing every year more and more. As the Esports community grows the chances and opportunities grow day by day leading to the advancement of the teams and growing individual content creators and players.


Although this new emerging gaming industry looks very interesting and tempting to be a part of it also has its fair share of demerits.

1. It creates psychological stress :
Gaming Continuously for hours and hours can cause us addiction which intern causes us mental stress leading to mental health issues like depression or feelings of low self-esteem.

2. It causes Self-isolation:
The passion of gaming for a long time can cause players to spend more time in it than they need to, this, in turn, causes them to stay alone and apart from their families

3. Very low chance of success:
Most gamers tend to make their career in gaming and for that, they put a lot of time and effort, and still, it doesn't guarantee a successful career ahead for them.

However, the kids who love gaming and use it for their pastimes or do it as a hobby also tend to benefit from it.

Some pros of gaming:
1. Development of Character:
Scientific research has proven that gaming can help a person with low self-confidence and social skills.
2. Quick in decision making:
Gamers often are very pressurized during intense gaming sessions and they often face situations where they need to take decisions quickly based on the current scenario. This in turn allows them to develop a skill to skill to analyze the situation and take action.

Now, what will be the future of gaming...?
From what I anticipate it is going to be the next big thing. I believe that we have just scratched the surface of the gaming world as new technology like AR and VR are introduced and many companies have already started to develop gaming products in this area like Facebook's Oculus quest 2 and PsVr.

			ðŸ¤” Do you know Evolution? ðŸŒŽ

In history, many individuals have tried to figure out how evolution works but no solid proof was submitted by any until Charles Darwin, one of the most influential people in all of history came up with the theory of Evolution known as Darwin's theory of evolution.

Young Charles always speculated and didn't believe that the world we see today was designed as it is today. The would have been some pattern or some methodology that guides how evolution works in real life. To gain more knowledge on this topic he traveled across the world, observing different species of animals in their natural habitats.

He spent about 20 years traveling different countries, studying, observing collecting information, and when he finally figured out 'Natural Selection'.

He explained that nature tries to alter its properties whichever best suits their survival. This process of altering the properties of any particular species takes a long time which is up to dozens of generations.

One example about long-headed and short-headed tortoise makes this clear.
The tortoise living in rainforests of the wet regions generally have short necks as the vegetation is easily available on the ground due to the availability of many small plants. On the opposite side, the tortoise living in the desert areas tend to develop a long neck so that they can eat a few plants which are about a few feet over the ground. The same theory goes behind the hardening and softening of turtle shells.

During his search, Darvin came across Alfred Russel Wallace and his lifelong results also point towards evolution due to natural selection. Darwin was worried if Wallace takes the Sole credit then his findings and efforts may go in vain so he partnered up with Wallace and released a joint letter. One year after Darwin released his book ''Origin of the species" he shooked the world and made him a superstar.

All the scientists and naturalists approved his theory and are relevant and will stay relevant forever.</span>
